# android-init

An opinionated starting point for Android apps

## Setup

android-init uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for analytics and crash reporting. To
setup analytics and crash reporting, [follow the steps on adding Firebase to your
app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app).

  1. Create a new Firebase project or add your app to an existing project.
  2. Generate and download the `google-services.json` configuration file.
  3. Replace the `google-services.json` file in the `app/` directory with yours.
